Nodecopter London Event
=======================

16th March 2013

A quick and dirty hack using Leap Motion to control the Parrot AR Drone built at NodeCopter London 2013.

# Usage
* Boot up your AR Drone
* Connect to it via wifi using your computer
* Start up the script
* Use your Leap Motion to control the drone
 * Move your hand over the Leap Motion device
 * Distance from the Leap controls the altitude of the drone
 * Moving your hand forward over the Leap makes the drone move forwards
 * Moving your hand to the left or right of the Leap strafes the drone left or right
 * Drawing a verticle circle in the air over the Leap makes the drone to a flip
 * Tapping with one finger in the air will cause the drone to land
